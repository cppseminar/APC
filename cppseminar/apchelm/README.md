# Deployment of kubernetes cluster

Everything can be installed with helm. Only secrets in folder `k8s` should be applied with `kubectl`.

## Mongo init script

Make sure config map in `./mongo/mongo-config.yaml` contain the same init script as in `../mongo/init-mongo.js`.

## Deploy using helm and kubectl

1. `cd` into this directory
2. Update values in `values.yaml`
3. `helm upgrade -i -f values.yaml apc .` where `apc` is the name of deployment.
4. Go into `k8s` directory and fill in the secrets.
5. `kubectl apply -f .\k8s\apc-secrets.yaml -n apc`

## Run db backup task

We have cron job for periodic backup task, so it may be a good idea to create initial db backup to see if it is working. 

`kubectl create job --from=cronjob/mongo-db-backup mongo-db-backup-manual-001 -n apc`

This command will create job `mongo-db-backup-manual-001` and run it immediatelly. 

# Running in minikube

You need to add following lines in `./templates/rabbitmq/apc-rabbitmq.yaml`. It is because on minikube there are some problems with privileges in mounted volumes.

```yaml
  override:
    statefulSet:
      spec:
        template:
          spec:
            containers: []
            securityContext: {}
            initContainers:
            - name: setup-container
              securityContext: {}
```

The same should be done for mongo replica set, by adding following to `./templates/mongo/mongo-db.yaml`.

```yaml
  statefulSet:
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          #  Hostpath volumes are owned by root
          #  but MongoDB containers run as non root
          #  so we use an init container to change the owner of
          #  the directory (init containers run as root)
          initContainers:
          - command:
            - chown
            - -R
            - "2000"
            - /data
            image: busybox
            volumeMounts:
            - mountPath: /data
              name: data-volume
            securityContext:
              runAsNonRoot: false
              runAsUser: 0
              runAsGroup: 0
            name: change-dir-permissions
```

## dockerconfigjson

`kubectl create secret docker-registry container-registry --docker-server=<your-registry-server> --docker-username=<your-username> --docker-password=<your-password> -n apc`

`<your-registry-server>` should be the same as `dockerRepository` in `values.yaml`.

# Updating operators

We use RabbitMQ and MongoDB Community operator. Those are not added as dependencies (that way we are not able to add them to namespace), nor do we force you to install them separatelly using helm. We have them inside `./crds/` folder and some parts are in `./templates/mongo/mongo-operator.yaml`. To update them your best bet is to install them using helm with `--dry-run` option and then copy the output to appropriate files.
